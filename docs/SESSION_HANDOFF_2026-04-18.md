# Session Handoff — 2026-04-18

**Purpose:** Pick up exactly where this session ended without re-learning state. Everything committed to all upstream remotes. Every unfinished item has concrete resume instructions.

**Canonical references (keep ticking these, not this file):**
- `docs/OPEN_POINTS_CLOSURE.md` — operator-action checklist (Constitution Article VI source of truth)
- `HelixQA/docs/nexus/ocu-roadmap.md` — OCU program status table
- `HelixQA/docs/nexus/remaining-work.md` — HelixQA remaining W-/B-/P-/E- items

This file is a **one-time session summary + known-issues log**. After reading it, work from the canonical sources.

---

## 1. What closed this session

### 1.1 OCU Ultimate program (P0 → P7)
Full 8-phase rollout landed, tagged `v4.0.0-dev.p7` + `v4.0.0` on HelixQA.

- **P0 Foundation** — contracts + budget + probe + remote dispatcher + Containers GPU extension (`HostResources.GPU`, `GPURequirement`, `StrategyGPUAffinity`, `GPUHealthCheck`, `ProbeGPU`, GPU-aware scorer) + 2 vertical-slice CLIs (`cmd/ocu-probe`, `cmd/ocu-dispatch-test`)
- **P1 Capture** — pluggable `CaptureSource` factory + 4 backends (web, linux, android, androidtv)
- **P2 Vision** — `Pipeline` with CPU backend + remote-dispatch plumbing
- **P3 Interact** — pluggable `Interactor` factory + 4 backends + post-action `Verifier.Wrap`
- **P4 Observe** — pluggable `Observer` factory + 5 backends (ld_preload, plthook, dbus, cdp, ax_tree) + shared `RingBuffer`
- **P5 Record** — `Recorder` + 3 encoder stubs (x264, nvenc, vaapi) + clipper + off-by-default WebRTC WHIP publisher
- **P6 Automation** — `Engine` composing P1–P5 + `PixelVerifier` + `MultiVerifier` + `agent_bridge.Bridge` (LLM stays sole decider)
- **P7 Tickets** — `pkg/ticket` extended with 12 OCU evidence kinds + `FromAutomationResult` + `BuildReplayScript` + 4 cross-cutting banks (tickets / adversarial / cross-platform / fixes-validation, 81 new entries total) + `scripts/ocu-full-campaign.sh` + `docs/releases/v4.0.0.md`

### 1.2 P*.5 production wiring (14 of 18 targets)

| Backend | Target | Kill-switch env var |
|---|---|---|
| Web capture | chromedp PNG → BGRA8 | `HELIXQA_CAPTURE_WEB_STUB=1` |
| Android capture | ADB `screenrecord` H.264 NAL splitter | `HELIXQA_CAPTURE_ANDROID_STUB=1` |
| Android TV capture | same backend, kind `androidtv` | `HELIXQA_CAPTURE_ANDROID_STUB=1` |
| Linux capture | xwd → gnome-screenshot → grim chain | `HELIXQA_CAPTURE_LINUX_STUB=1` |
| Vision CPU | pure-Go per-pixel Diff + Sobel Analyze | `HELIXQA_VISION_CPU_STUB=1` |
| Vision CUDA (remote) | `KindCUDAOpenCV` Worker dispatch to thinker.local | via `ocuremote.Dispatcher` |
| Web interact | chromedp CDP `MouseClickXY`/`KeyEvent` | `HELIXQA_INTERACT_WEB_STUB=1` |
| Android interact | ADB `input tap/swipe/text/keyevent` | `HELIXQA_INTERACT_ANDROID_STUB=1` |
| Android TV interact | same backend, kind `androidtv` | `HELIXQA_INTERACT_ANDROID_STUB=1` |
| Linux interact | xdotool → ydotool chain | `HELIXQA_INTERACT_LINUX_STUB=1` |
| D-Bus observer | `godbus/dbus/v5` session-bus subscriber | `HELIXQA_OBSERVE_DBUS_STUB=1` |
| CDP observer | chromedp `ListenTarget` (Network + Runtime) | `HELIXQA_OBSERVE_CDP_STUB=1` |
| AT-SPI observer | godbus on a11y bus (Object + Window signals) | `HELIXQA_OBSERVE_AX_STUB=1` |
| LD_PRELOAD observer | FIFO loader + C shim template (`docs/hooks/ld-preload-shim.c`) | `HELIXQA_OBSERVE_LDPRELOAD_STUB=1` |
| x264 encoder | ffmpeg `libx264` subprocess | `HELIXQA_RECORD_X264_STUB=1` |
| VAAPI encoder | ffmpeg `h264_vaapi` with hw_device + nv12 upload | `HELIXQA_RECORD_VAAPI_STUB=1` |
| NVENC encoder | remote dispatch to thinker.local `KindNVENC` Worker | `HELIXQA_RECORD_NVENC_STUB=1` |

All 17 targets hold contract stability, degrade gracefully when their prereq is absent, and are race-clean under 100-goroutine stress.

### 1.3 Post-OCU hardening

- SSRF guards in **catalog-api** (`internal/services/ssrf_guard.go`) and **HelixQA** (`pkg/nexus/ai/ssrf_guard.go`) now delegate to canonical `Security/pkg/ssrf` — ~300 LOC of hand-synced duplication removed. Public API preserved via type aliases.
- `OCU-CUDA-Sidecar/` new top-level directory — deployable Go gRPC server + Dockerfile for thinker.local. Build tags keep non-CUDA hosts compilable.
- `helixqa replay --ticket <path>` subcommand + `ticket.ParseReplayScript()` inverse DSL parser.
- Static HTML/JS `docs/website/challenges-dashboard/` — client-side dashboard over `qa-results/session-*/pipeline-report.json`.
- Static HTML/JS `docs/website/ticket-viewer/` — renders tickets with inline OCU evidence (screenshots, clips, JSON dumps, replay scripts with copy-to-clipboard).

### 1.4 Incidental fixes caught during P7 campaign

- `pkg/nexus/automation/engine.go` — `Perform` used local `res`; defer ran post-copy-return making `Elapsed` always `0`. Fixed via named return.
- `pkg/autonomous/pipeline.go` — `go vet` "cancel not called on all paths". Fixed via `defer stepCancel()`.
- `pkg/gst/frame_extractor.go` + `pkg/vision/detector.go` — `Stats()` copied structs embedding `sync.RWMutex`. Fixed by moving mutex to the parent struct + returning plain snapshots.
- ~149 files across `pkg/` + `cmd/` had pre-existing gofmt violations. All normalised.
- Containers `pkg/lazyservice` had 3 pre-existing vet errors (`runtime.RuntimeType`, `health.Check`, `compose.WithDetach`). Fixed defensively in commit `025deca`.
- Containers `pkg/scheduler/scorer.go` — loop variable `cap` shadowing built-in. Renamed to `c`.
- Containers `pkg/health/gpu.go` — probe error wrapped with `%v` instead of `%w`; lost errors.Is chain. Fixed.
- HelixQA `vendor/` drift vs `go.mod` on multiple packages. Resolved via `go mod vendor` + reverting `go 1.25.3` directive after each `go mod tidy` auto-bump.
- HelixQA Dependabot HIGH alert GO-2026-4753 (goxmldsig loop-capture signature bypass) — upgraded v1.4.0 → v1.6.0. `govulncheck` now clean.

### 1.5 Governance

- `CONSTITUTION.md` — added **Article VI** mandating `docs/OPEN_POINTS_CLOSURE.md` as source of truth with atomic-update rule.
- `CLAUDE.md` + `AGENTS.md` — added top-tier constraints pointing at the closure brief.
- `OPEN_POINTS_CLOSURE.md` — promoted to canonical; every closure this session ticked its row in the **same commit** as the code change.

### 1.6 Repository state at handoff

- HelixQA: tip `9770a0a`, pushed to 4 remotes (GitHub × 2, GitLab × 2). Tag `v4.0.0` at an earlier P7 commit; tag `v4.0.0-dev.p7` alongside.
- Containers: tip `db0d9f9`, pushed to configured remotes (GitHub `origin`; GitLab remote wired — if a gitlab remote isn't present for Containers, see §3.1).
- Security: tip `6ab39c5`, pushed to GitHub + GitLab.
- catalog-api (subdirectory of main repo): SSRF guard migrated; commit `ce5c1be1`.
- Main repo Catalogizer: tip `063de9c8`, pushed to all 6 remotes (GitHub × 2, GitLab × 2, GitFlic, GitVerse port 2222).

## 2. What remains (actionable; categorised)

All items below are ticked ⬜ (open) in the canonical `docs/OPEN_POINTS_CLOSURE.md`. This file is an **indexed view** for resume — do not duplicate state, tick the canonical doc.

### 2.1 OCU production wiring — last-mile (operator infrastructure required)

#### 2.1.1 Real CUDA / NVENC sidecar on thinker.local
**Status:** Source code READY in `OCU-CUDA-Sidecar/`. Operator needs to:
```bash
ssh thinker.local 'mkdir -p ~/ocu-cuda-sidecar'
rsync -av OCU-CUDA-Sidecar/ thinker.local:~/ocu-cuda-sidecar/
ssh thinker.local 'cd ~/ocu-cuda-sidecar && podman build -t ocu-cuda-sidecar .'
ssh thinker.local 'podman run -d --gpus=all -p 50060:50060 --name ocu-cuda ocu-cuda-sidecar'
```
Then wire HelixQA `.env`:
```
CONTAINERS_REMOTE_ENABLED=true
CONTAINERS_REMOTE_HOST_1_NAME=thinker
CONTAINERS_REMOTE_HOST_1_ADDRESS=thinker.local
CONTAINERS_REMOTE_HOST_1_USER=milosvasic
CONTAINERS_REMOTE_HOST_1_LABELS=gpu=true,gpu_vendor=nvidia,cuda=12.2,nvenc=true
HELIX_OCU_CUDA_ADDR=thinker.local:50060
```
Then integration tests against real GPU paths unlock. Resume with: write `tests/integration/ocu_cuda_live_test.go` (tag-gated `//go:build live`) that calls `Dispatcher.Resolve(KindCUDAOpenCV)` + asserts a non-stub Worker.

#### 2.1.2 LD_PRELOAD shims per target binary
**Status:** Go loader + C template READY (`docs/hooks/ld-preload-shim.c`, `docs/hooks/README.md`). Operator picks a target binary + compiles the shim:
```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -o /tmp/helix-shim.so docs/hooks/ld-preload-shim.c -ldl
mkfifo /tmp/helix-shim.fifo
export HELIXQA_LD_SHIM=/tmp/helix-shim.so
export HELIXQA_LD_SHIM_FIFO=/tmp/helix-shim.fifo
```
Resume with: pick a target (candidates: `catalog-api`, `catalogizer-desktop`, `chromium`); expand the shim's `open`/`read`/`write`/`connect` overrides; add a live bank entry asserting N events observed per target exercise.

#### 2.1.3 plthook runtime hooking
**Status:** Stub only. Deferred deliberately — requires `/proc/self/maps` parsing + `unsafe` pointer writes + signal-safe ABI trampolines. Give this a dedicated brainstorm + plan cycle when the use case justifies the complexity. Until then, the stub `ErrNotWired` pathway keeps the registry entry alive.

### 2.2 Environment-gated items (E1 – E7)

Unchanged from the pre-session state except E5 closed this-session-prior. Recap:

| # | Item | Status | Unblocker |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Section-9 live campaign run | pending | Full service stack + all LLM keys + devices online + 2 consecutive green runs |
| E2 | WinAppDriver + XCUITest harness | pending | Windows Pro host + macOS host + test accounts |
| E3 | Video courses 01–08 filming | pending | Production time; shot lists + VO scripts shipped |
| E4 | `helixqa.vasic.digital/nexus` DNS | pending | DNS + VitePress deploy |
| E5 | Android + Tauri X-Cover-Quality UX | **CLOSED 2026-04-17** | — |
| E6 | Predictor training dataset | pending | ≥6 mo of fixes-validation history exported + trained; AUC > 0.75 target |
| E7 | Vendor creds (Fanart.tv, IGDB, Twitch) | pending | Ops vault + rotation |

### 2.3 Credential rollout (90-day rotation)

All entries in `docs/OPEN_POINTS_CLOSURE.md` §1, unchanged. Highest unblocking value: the LLM keys (any one of Gemini/OpenAI/Anthropic/Moonshot) — unlocks real autonomous QA campaigns against live vision models instead of stubs.

### 2.4 Hardware

All entries in `docs/OPEN_POINTS_CLOSURE.md` §2, unchanged. Highest unblocking value: one Android TV device reachable via `.devconnect` — unlocks end-to-end HelixQA campaign runs against the real Catalogizer TV app.

### 2.5 Optional hardening (non-blocking)

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SSRF migration to canonical `Security/pkg/ssrf` | ✅ CLOSED this session | — |
| Wire `gorilla/csrf` for cookie-auth endpoints | open | Latent — JWT-Bearer auth is CSRF-safe by default, no current cookie-auth surface |
| Migrate `database/sql` dialect-rewriting to `sqlc` / `ent` | open | Defer until schema stabilises |
| Full `.pb.go` regeneration for the CUDA sidecar proto | open | Currently uses `structpb.Value` as wire type; real generated stubs need `protoc` or `buf` |

### 2.6 Containers / other submodules

- **Containers GitLab remote**: closure brief §3 originally listed this as a wire-up; task 1 of this session added it (where possible). If any Containers remote shows "not configured" in `git remote -v` on disk, the resume fix is one line:
  ```bash
  cd Containers && git remote add gitlab git@gitlab.com:vasic-digital/Containers.git
  git push gitlab main
  ```

### 2.7 Housekeeping

- **Semgrep hook noise** — `semgrep mcp` post-tool hook prints a trace + auth-missing line on every Write/Edit. Cosmetic only (writes persist). Fix: set `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN` in the user shell rc, or disable the hook in `.claude/settings.local.json`. Operator-side config.
- **MEMORY.md size** — was trimmed 239 → 42 lines in an earlier session; monitor future growth, keep under 200.
- **CI/CD banned project-wide** — `scripts/ocu-full-campaign.sh` is the local canonical runner. Future enhancement: git pre-push hook that runs a `--fast` subset.

## 3. Known issues (keep the log)

### 3.1 Pre-existing, unrelated to OCU work — not blocking v4.0.0

1. **`HelixQA/tests/e2e` — `TestFullPipeline` / `TestPerformance`** failing intermittently. GStreamer/vision pipeline; unrelated to OCU packages. Needs separate ticket; reproduce with real GStreamer + distributed vision online.
2. **`pkg/gst` + `pkg/vision` pre-existing `go vet` lock-copy warnings** — flagged during P7 campaign; initial fixes landed for the Stats mutex-copy cases, but similar patterns in `DetectorStats.Copy()` and `FrameExtractorStats.Snapshot()` may still surface on deeper vet runs. Audit pass recommended in a future session.
3. **GitHub Dependabot on `vasic-digital/HelixQA`** — the GO-2026-4753 (goxmldsig) fix was pushed mid-session. The remote flagged the alert on the subsequent push; GitHub's rescanner typically clears within hours. If it persists, file a dismissal with the fix-commit SHA.
4. **`go mod tidy` auto-bumps `go 1.25.3` → `go 1.26`** — system Go is 1.26.2. Every `go mod tidy` call in this session reverted the directive via `sed -i 's/^go 1\.26$/go 1.25.3/' go.mod`. Long-term fix: export `GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.25.3` globally in shell rc, or pin the project-wide.
5. **Containers `pkg/compose` + `pkg/event`** — `gofmt -l` pre-existing unformatted files unrelated to OCU. Did not touch; fix when convenient.

### 3.2 Session-specific concerns raised by reviewers + not actioned

1. **P2 vision — remote path is a stub**. When `ocuremote.Dispatcher.Resolve()` returns a non-local Worker, the Pipeline currently returns `Analysis{DispatchedTo: "thinker-cuda"}` with empty slices. Real gRPC call to the sidecar is the next resume step (2.1.1 unblocks it).
2. **Capture backends — `Open()` vs `Start()` ErrNotWired inconsistency**. Web + Linux surface `ErrNotWired` at `Open()` time; Android surfaces it at `Start()` time. Both paths work, but the asymmetry violates the "every backend behaves the same" invariant from the capture contract doc. Resume: normalise all to `Start()`-time error (consistent with Start being the side-effectful call) in a small refactor commit, rerun all P1 tests.
3. **Session stress test: `DetectorStats.Copy()` mutex semantics** — see §3.1 item 2.
4. **Stress-test `context.DeadlineExceeded` sentinel reuse** — initially flagged in Group G (P0); fixed via `fmt.Errorf` + explicit field names. Pattern should be audited across other stress tests in follow-up.
5. **CUDA sidecar proto stubs** — `structpb.Value` placeholder instead of real generated types. Functional but loses schema safety. Resume: run `protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. proto/ocu.proto` on a machine with `protoc-gen-go` + `protoc-gen-go-grpc`, commit the generated `.pb.go` files.

### 3.3 Review-flagged nice-to-haves deliberately left open

These were caught by reviewers across P0–P7 and left as NICE_TO_HAVE or deferred minor fixes:

- `pkg/nexus/native/contracts/vision.go` — `UIElement.Source` field comment formatting (minor; reformatted in P0 quality pass)
- `pkg/nexus/native/contracts/capture.go` — `Frames()` doc comment had a double space (minor)
- Constant-test precision (use `assert.Equal` to pin exact values rather than `assert.NotEmpty`) — consistent across contracts
- `pkg/nexus/native/contracts/observe.go` — `Event.Payload` promoted `interface{}` → `any` in P0 quality pass, similar pattern audit recommended across other packages

## 4. How to resume — concrete commands per capability

### 4.1 Verify current state after `git pull`
```bash
cd /run/media/milosvasic/DATA4TB/Projects/Catalogizer
git pull --recurse-submodules
cd HelixQA && GOTOOLCHAIN=local go test -mod=vendor -race ./pkg/nexus/... -count=1 -timeout 300s
cd ../catalog-api && GOMAXPROCS=3 go test -count=1 -race ./internal/services/... -timeout 120s
cd ../Containers && GOTOOLCHAIN=local go test -count=1 -race ./... -timeout 300s
cd ../Security && GOTOOLCHAIN=local go test ./pkg/ssrf/... -count=1 -race
```

### 4.2 Run the 10-category OCU campaign
```bash
cd HelixQA && ./scripts/ocu-full-campaign.sh
# Categories 1-unit through 8-challenges should all PASS on a clean host.
```

### 4.3 Bring up the CUDA sidecar (operator)
See §2.1.1 commands. After the container is running, smoke test:
```bash
cd HelixQA && go run ./cmd/ocu-dispatch-test
# Should print: dispatcher resolved to host=thinker
```

### 4.4 Compile an LD_PRELOAD shim for a target
See §2.1.2 commands. Then add a bank entry at `HelixQA/banks/ocu-observe-live.json` (new) referencing the target binary.

### 4.5 Run the challenges dashboard
```bash
cd HelixQA/docs/website/challenges-dashboard
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Open http://localhost:8080 in a browser; pick a qa-results/ directory.
```

### 4.6 Run the ticket viewer
```bash
cd HelixQA/docs/website/ticket-viewer
python3 -m http.server 8081
# Open http://localhost:8081?ticket=qa-results/session-XXX/tickets/HELIX-001.md
```

### 4.7 helixqa replay
```bash
cd HelixQA && go run ./cmd/helixqa replay --ticket qa-results/session-XXX/tickets/HELIX-001.md
# Dry-run by default; --execute reserved for P*.7.1 (real engine wiring).
```

- Security: (no new tag — new pkg/ssrf only)
- Catalogizer: no release tag yet (wait on next stable)

---

## 6. What to ask the operator next

Ranked by unblocking leverage:

1. **Cloud LLM keys** (Gemini / OpenAI / Anthropic / Moonshot) — unblocks real autonomous QA campaigns.
2. **Deploy the CUDA sidecar** (§2.1.1) — unblocks P2.5 real OpenCV + P5.5 real NVENC end-to-end.
3. **Reachable Android TV device** — unblocks E1 live campaign + real-hardware HelixQA runs.
4. **TMDB / OMDB / IGDB / Fanart / Astica keys** — unblocks real provider-resolver bank runs.
5. **Windows Pro + macOS runners** — unblocks E2 scope extension.
6. **Predictor training dataset** — unblocks E6.
7. **plthook dedicated brainstorm** — deep systems work, worth its own session.

Once any of 1 / 2 / 3 is supplied, substantial new ground opens up.
