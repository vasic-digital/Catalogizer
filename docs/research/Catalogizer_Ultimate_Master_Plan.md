## 1. Executive Summary

This document is the single source of truth for completing the Catalogizer project to a **100% functional state with zero defects**. It is not a suggestion — it is a mechanical execution plan derived from the universal principles of fixing AI-assisted large-scale projects, applied specifically to the Catalogizer multi-platform media collection management system.

### 1.1 The Core Problem

Despite **1,004+ commits**, extensive documentation (50+ markdown files), high reported test coverage, and multiple "completion reports," the fundamental problem persists: **the code compiles, tests pass, but the product does not work when manually tested.** This is the classic "green tests, broken product" phenomenon documented in `Fixing_big_projects.md`.

### 1.2 The Root Cause Diagnosis

After comprehensive analysis of the repository, issues, documentation, and commit history, the root causes are:

| # | Root Cause | Evidence | Impact |
|---|-----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Semantic Violations** | AI-generated code breaks unwritten architectural rules | Features appear complete but fail in integration |
| 2 | **Mock-Only Testing** | High unit test coverage with mocked dependencies | Real services (SMB, FTP, NFS, WebDAV) never exercised |
| 3 | **Disabled Features Shipped** | `.go.disabled` files for conversion, recognition, recommendation | Core capabilities non-functional despite "completion" |
| 4 | **Missing Integration Layer** | Frontend ↔ Backend ↔ Mobile contracts not enforced | API changes break downstream silently |
| 5 | **No End-to-End Validation** | No full user journey testing | Login → Browse → Play → Settings flows untested |
| 6 | **Fragmented Documentation** | 50+ docs with conflicting "completion" statuses | No single source of truth for what actually works |
| 7 | **Premature Phase Closure** | Issues #2-#8 marked "completed" in comments but remain open | False sense of progress |

### 1.3 The Solution Architecture

This plan implements a **mechanical verification engine** around the AI development workflow. It replaces trust with proof at every layer. The approach is:

1. **Document the Undocumented** — Capture all institutional knowledge
2. **Test the Untested** — Integration, E2E, and real-protocol testing
3. **Enable the Disabled** — Re-enable and fix all `.disabled` features
4. **Verify the Unverified** — Full-QA Master Cycle per CONSTITUTION.md Article VII
5. **Close for Real** — No issue closes without demonstrable proof

---

## 2. The Universal Problem & The Universal Solution

### 2.1 Why AI-Generated Code Fails in Production

The document `Fixing_big_projects.md` identifies a well-documented phenomenon: LLMs excel at generating syntactically correct code that passes isolated unit tests, but fail to understand the context-dependent rules that make complex systems actually work. In the Catalogizer project specifically:

- **42 Go backend files** have critical implementation gaps despite "passing" tests
- **Conversion System** is entirely disabled (`*.go.disabled`)
- **Media Recognition** features are disabled
- **Recommendation System** is disabled
- **Deep Linking** is disabled
- **SMB Testing** — critical protocol tests are disabled
- **Video Player Subtitle Type Mismatch** at `video_player_service.go:1366` — a real bug masked by mocks
- **Authentication Rate Limiting Bypassed** at `auth/middleware.go:285` — security hole invisible to unit tests

### 2.2 The 8-Step Universal Fix (Applied to Catalogizer)

The universal approach from `Fixing_big_projects.md` is adapted specifically for Catalogizer:

#### Step 1: Institutional Knowledge Mapping
**Goal:** Capture every unwritten rule that "everyone just knows."

**Action for Catalogizer:**
- Create `docs/LANDMINES.md` with platform-specific rules
- Document the 41-submodule dependency graph with exact versioning
- Map the API contract between `catalog-api` and all clients (web, android, androidtv, desktop)
- Document the media type detection heuristics (50+ media types)
- Record the protocol-specific error handling patterns (SMB reconnection, FTP passive mode, NFS mount retry)

#### Step 2: Rebalance the Testing Pyramid
**Goal:** Move from unit-test-only to full pyramid coverage.

**Action for Catalogizer:**
| Test Category | Current State | Target State | Method |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| Unit Tests | ~95% reported | 95% verified real | Remove mock-only tests, add real dependencies |
| Integration Tests | Minimal | 100% API coverage | Test each endpoint with real DB + real services |
| Protocol Tests | Disabled | All protocols active | Spin up SMB/FTP/NFS/WebDAV containers in CI |
| E2E Tests | None | All critical journeys | Playwright (web) + Espresso (Android) + Tauri (desktop) |
| Contract Tests | None | All API contracts | Pact or custom contract validation |
| Security Tests | Basic | Full coverage | OWASP ZAP + custom auth/rate-limit tests |
| Stress Tests | None | API + file operations | k6 load tests + concurrent file scan tests |
| Visual Regression | None | All platforms | Screenshot comparison per PR |

#### Step 3: Implement the Verification Loop
**Goal:** Every AI-generated change must pass verification before human review.

**Action for Catalogizer:**
- Create the Self-Correcting Prompt Chain for Claude Code
- Define exact verification commands per module (see Section 8.1)
- Enforce: IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → REPORT → ESCALATE workflow
- No code merges without passing the full verification gate

#### Step 4: LLM-as-Judge Layer
**Goal:** Catch semantic violations that tests cannot see.

**Action for Catalogizer:**
- Pre-merge review prompt targeting Catalogizer-specific rules
- Check against `LANDMINES.md` rules
- Verify API contract compatibility
- Check for disabled feature references in "completed" code

#### Step 5: CLAUDE.md as Operating System
**Goal:** The AI must read and follow project-specific constraints.

**Action for Catalogizer:**
- The existing `CLAUDE.md` is comprehensive — it must be enforced
- Every Claude Code session must start with: "Read CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, CONSTITUTION.md, and docs/LANDMINES.md before any code change"
- The Full-QA Master Cycle (Article VII) must be mechanically followed, not referenced

#### Step 6: Multi-Agent Review
**Goal:** Separate author and reviewer roles.

**Action for Catalogizer:**
- Agent 1 (Author): Implements the feature
- Agent 2 (Reviewer): Reviews against architecture and LANDMINES
- Agent 3 (Structure): Checks consistency, copy-paste errors, best practices

#### Step 7: Operational Guardrails
**Goal:** Prevent AI from breaking production environment assumptions.

**Action for Catalogizer:**
- Explicit environment definition in every prompt
- Feature flags for all AI-generated changes
- Real-device testing mandate (Article VIII of CONSTITUTION.md)

#### Step 8: Continuous Learning
**Goal:** Every bug found becomes a rule that prevents future bugs.

**Action for Catalogizer:**
- Every manual test failure → new LANDMINES rule + new test
- Monthly review of AI-generated code quality metrics
- Update verification commands as the codebase evolves

## 5. Phase-by-Phase Granular Breakdown

---

### PHASE 1: Institutional Knowledge Capture
**Duration: 3 days | Owner: Lead Architect + AI Agent**

**Goal:** Create the complete `docs/LANDMINES.md` file that captures every unwritten rule, and establish API contracts between all components.

**Entry Criteria:** None — this is the starting phase.

**1.1 Task: Landmine Rule Extraction**

Step-by-step method:
1. Read every existing `.md` file in the repository root (50+ files)
2. Extract all "must", "never", "always", "critical", "WARNING" statements
3. Interview (via document analysis) the implicit rules from commit messages
4. Map the 41-submodule dependency graph with exact `replace` directives
5. Document the API contract between `catalog-api` and each client

**The LANDMINES.md Template (to be created):**

```markdown
# Catalogizer Production Landmines & Semantic Rules

## Go Backend Rules
- **RULE-GO-001: No context.Background() in request handlers**
  - Context: All DB and HTTP calls MUST respect ctx.Done()
  - Detection: grep -r "context.Background()" internal/handler/ internal/service/
  - Fix: Use the request context, pass it through all call chains

- **RULE-GO-002: SMB Reconnection Grace Period**

  - Detection: Find all .disabled files, all t.Skip() calls without TODO
  - Fix: Re-enable and fix, or delete with explicit justification

- **RULE-GO-006: FFmpeg Integration Error Handling**
  - Context: FFmpeg can fail silently; errors must propagate
  - Detection: Check Media module FFmpeg wrapper error paths
  - Fix: Every FFmpeg call must check exit code and stderr

- **RULE-GO-007: SQLCipher Key Management**
  - Context: Database encryption key must never be logged
  - Detection: Check all fmt.Printf, log.Printf for key strings
  - Fix: Key in env only, redact in all logs

## React/Web Rules
- **RULE-WEB-001: API Response Caching**
  - Context: /api/v1/user must not be browser-cached
  - Detection: Check fetch calls for Cache-Control headers
  - Fix: Set Cache-Control: no-cache on auth endpoints

- **RULE-WEB-002: WebSocket Reconnection**
  - Context: WebSocket disconnects are normal; must auto-reconnect
  - Detection: Check WebSocket client reconnection logic
  - Fix: Exponential backoff reconnection with max retry limit

- **RULE-WEB-003: Zero Console Warnings**
  - Context: Warnings indicate potential runtime issues
  - Detection: npm run dev → check browser console
  - Fix: Resolve every warning, no exceptions

## Android Rules
- **RULE-AND-001: Scoped Storage Compliance**
  - Context: Android 13+ requires scoped storage
  - Detection: Check FileProvider usage, manifest permissions
  - Fix: Use MediaStore API for media access

  - Fix: Add -keep for all Retrofit/Gson/Reflection models

## Android TV Rules
- **RULE-TV-001: HTTP/1.1 Only**
  - Context: Android TV (API 28) fails HTTP/2 handshake on some chipsets
  - Detection: Check OkHttpClient.Builder in TV module
  - Fix: Explicitly set .protocols(listOf(Protocol.HTTP_1_1))

- **RULE-TV-002: D-Pad Navigation Focus**
  - Context: TV users navigate with D-pad, not touch
  - Detection: Every new UI element must handle focus
  - Fix: Implement Focusable, test focus traversal order

  - Detection: Check for standard Android UI components in TV module
  - Fix: Use BrowseSupportFragment, DetailsSupportFragment, etc.

## Desktop (Tauri) Rules
- **RULE-DESK-001: Rust Error Propagation**
  - Context: unwrap() in Rust crashes the entire application
  - Detection: grep -r "unwrap()" src-tauri/src/
  - Fix: Replace with proper Result handling

- **RULE-DESK-002: File Protocol Security**
  - Context: Tauri file access must be explicitly allowed
  - Detection: Check tauri.conf.json allowlist
  - Fix: Minimal permissions, scoped to media directories
```

**1.2 Task: API Contract Documentation**

Create `docs/API_CONTRACTS.md` with:

1. Every endpoint in `catalog-api` with:
   - Method, path, request body schema, response schema
   - Auth requirements (public / JWT / API key)
   - Rate limit tier
   - Which clients call it (web, android, androidtv, desktop)

2. WebSocket event contracts:
   - Event types pushed from server
   - Event format (JSON schema)
   - Client-side handlers

3. Real-time update contracts:
   - What triggers a WebSocket push
   - Debouncing/throttling rules

**1.3 Task: Submodule Dependency Map**

Create `docs/SUBMODULE_DEPENDENCIES.md`:

1. Graph of all 41 submodules
2. Which submodules depend on which
3. Version pinning strategy
4. Update cadence per submodule

**Verification for Phase 1:**
```bash
# Must pass: All documents created and non-empty
[ -s docs/LANDMINES.md ] && [ -s docs/API_CONTRACTS.md ] && [ -s docs/SUBMODULE_DEPENDENCIES.md ]
# Must pass: LANDMINES has at least 20 rules
grep -c "^##" docs/LANDMINES.md | xargs -I {} test {} -ge 20
# Must pass: API_CONTRACTS documents all endpoints
grep -c "^###" docs/API_CONTRACTS.md | xargs -I {} test {} -ge 30
```

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] `docs/LANDMINES.md` exists with ≥20 platform-specific rules
- [ ] `docs/API_CONTRACTS.md` exists with all endpoints documented
- [ ] `docs/SUBMODULE_DEPENDENCIES.md` exists with dependency graph
- [ ] All 3 documents reviewed by LLM-as-Judge

---

### PHASE 2: Test Infrastructure Resurrection
**Duration: 5 days | Owner: QA Lead + AI Agent**

**Goal:** Replace mock-heavy tests with real-dependency tests. Build the infrastructure to test against actual protocols and databases.

**Entry Criteria:** Phase 1 complete (LANDMINES documented).

**2.1 Task: Docker Test Infrastructure**

Create `docker-compose.test-infra.yml` with:

```yaml
# SMB Server for protocol testing
smb-test-server:
  image: dperson/samba
  volumes:
    - smb-test-data:/mount
  environment:
    - USERNAME=testuser;testpass
  ports:
    - "4445:445"

# FTP Server for protocol testing
ftp-test-server:
  image: stilliard/pure-ftpd
  environment:
    - FTP_USER_NAME=testuser
    - FTP_USER_PASS=testpass
    - FTP_USER_HOME=/home/testuser
  ports:
    - "2100:21"
    - "30000-30009:30000-30009"

# NFS Server for protocol testing
nfs-test-server:
  image: erichough/nfs-server
  environment:
    - NFS_EXPORT_0=/mnt/test-data 10.0.0.0/8(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
  volumes:
    - nfs-test-data:/mnt/test-data
  ports:
    - "2049:2049"

# WebDAV Server for protocol testing
webdav-test-server:
  image byterendition/webdav
  environment:
    - WEBDAV_USERNAME=testuser
    - WEBDAV_PASSWORD=testpass
  ports:
    - "8080:80"

# Redis for rate limiting tests
redis-test:
  image: redis:7-alpine
  ports:
    - "6379:6379"
```

**2.2 Task: Go Backend Integration Test Suite**

For each module in `catalog-api`:

1. Create `internal/tests/integration/` directory
2. Write tests that:
   - Start a real SQLite database (not in-memory — file-based with SQLCipher)
   - Connect to Dockerized protocol servers
   - Exercise the full handler → service → repository → DB chain
   - Verify response format matches API contract

Example test structure:
```go
func TestMediaDetection_Integration(t *testing.T) {
    // Setup real test infrastructure
    db := setupRealTestDB(t)
    smbServer := setupSMBTestContainer(t)
    
    // Execute real detection
    result, err := media.Detect(smbServer.GetSharePath("/movies"))
    
    // Verify real results (not mocks)
    require.NoError(t, err)
    require.NotEmpty(t, result)
    require.Equal(t, "movie", result[0].MediaType)
    require.FileExists(t, result[0].ThumbnailPath) // Real thumbnail generated
}
```

**2.3 Task: Frontend Integration Test Suite**

1. Set up MSW (Mock Service Worker) with realistic API responses
2. Create integration tests for:
   - Login flow → token storage → authenticated request
   - Media browse → detail → play flow
   - Settings → save → persist → reload verification
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket

3. Create E2E tests with Playwright:
```typescript
// E2E test: Full user journey
test('complete media browsing journey', async ({ page }) => {
  // Login
  await page.goto('/login');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="username"]', 'admin');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="password"]', 'admin');
  await page.click('[data-testid="login-button"]');
  
  // Wait for dashboard
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="dashboard"]')).toBeVisible();
  
  // Navigate to media
  await page.click('[data-testid="media-nav"]');
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="media-grid"]')).toBeVisible();
  
  // Click on a media item
  await page.click('[data-testid="media-item"]:first-child');
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="media-detail"]')).toBeVisible();
  
  // Play
  await page.click('[data-testid="play-button"]');
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="video-player"]')).toBeVisible();
  
  // Verify no console errors
  const consoleErrors = [];
  page.on('console', msg => {
    if (msg.type() === 'error') consoleErrors.push(msg.text());
  });
  expect(consoleErrors).toHaveLength(0);
});
```

**2.4 Task: Android Instrumentation Tests**

1. Create `app/src/androidTest/java/` test suite
2. Tests that run on real device/emulator:
   - LoginActivity → MainActivity navigation
   - Media browser → detail → player flow
   - SyncService with real network calls
   - Scoped storage file operations
   - Background playback

**2.5 Task: Contract Test Suite**

Create `tests/contract/` with Pact or custom implementation:

```go
// Contract test: catalog-api → catalog-web
func TestContract_MediaListResponse(t *testing.T) {
    response := callAPIMediaList()
    
    // Verify schema matches contract
    assert.NotEmpty(t, response.Items)
    assert.NotZero(t, response.TotalCount)
    
    // Verify each item has required fields
    for _, item := range response.Items {
        assert.NotEmpty(t, item.ID)
        assert.NotEmpty(t, item.Title)
        assert.NotEmpty(t, item.MediaType)
        assert.NotNil(t, item.ThumbnailURL)
        // Verify media type is one of 50+ known types
        assert.Contains(t, validMediaTypes, item.MediaType)
    }
}
```

**Verification for Phase 2:**
```bash
# Start test infrastructure
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test-infra.yml up -d

# Backend integration tests
cd catalog-api && go test ./... -tags=integration -count=1

# Frontend E2E tests
cd catalog-web && npm run test:e2e

# Android instrumented tests
cd catalogizer-android && ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest

# Contract tests
cd tests/contract && go test ./... -count=1
```

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Docker test infrastructure starts cleanly
- [ ] ≥50 integration tests passing for backend
- [ ] ≥10 E2E tests passing for web
- [ ] ≥10 instrumented tests passing for Android
- [ ] Contract tests validate all API endpoints
- [ ] CI pipeline runs all test categories

---

### PHASE 4: Critical Bug Extermination
**Duration: 7 days | Owner: Backend Lead + AI Agent**

**Goal:** Fix every known critical/high bug with root-cause analysis and regression tests.

**Entry Criteria:** Phase 3 complete (disabled features re-enabled).

**4.1 Task: Video Player Subtitle Type Mismatch (video_player_service.go:1366)**

Root cause analysis:
1. Read the code at line 1366
2. Identify the type mismatch (likely string vs []byte for subtitle content)
3. Trace the data flow from subtitle file → parser → player
4. Fix the type at the source
5. Add type assertions at boundaries

Regression test:
```go
func TestVideoPlayer_SubtitleTypeConsistency(t *testing.T) {
    // Load test video with embedded subtitles
    video := loadTestVideo("test_subtitle.mkv")
    
    // Extract subtitles
    subtitles, err := video.ExtractSubtitles()
    require.NoError(t, err)
    
    // Pass to player — must not panic on type mismatch
    player := NewPlayer(video)
    err = player.LoadSubtitles(subtitles)
    require.NoError(t, err)
    
    // Verify subtitle text is renderable
    require.IsType(t, string(""), subtitles[0].Text)
}
```

**4.2 Task: Authentication Rate Limiting Bypass (auth/middleware.go:285)**

Root cause analysis:
1. Examine current rate limiting implementation
2. Identify bypass vector (likely IP spoofing or path bypass)
3. Implement Redis-backed sliding window
4. Add tests for: Normal use, Edge of limit, Over limit, IP spoofing attempt

```go
func TestAuth_RateLimiting_CannotBypass(t *testing.T) {
    redis := setupTestRedis(t)
    middleware := auth.NewRateLimitMiddleware(redis, 10, time.Minute)
    
    handler := middleware(http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    }))
    
    // 10 requests should succeed
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        req := httptest.NewRequest("GET", "/api/v1/media", nil)
        rr := httptest.NewRecorder()
        handler.ServeHTTP(rr, req)
        assert.Equal(t, http.StatusOK, rr.Code)
    }
    
    // 11th request should be rate limited
    req := httptest.NewRequest("GET", "/api/v1/media", nil)
    rr := httptest.NewRecorder()
    handler.ServeHTTP(rr, req)
    assert.Equal(t, http.StatusTooManyRequests, rr.Code)
    
    // Attempt IP spoofing — should not bypass
    req = httptest.NewRequest("GET", "/api/v1/media", nil)
    req.Header.Set("X-Forwarded-For", "1.2.3.4")
    rr = httptest.NewRecorder()
    handler.ServeHTTP(rr, req)
    assert.Equal(t, http.StatusTooManyRequests, rr.Code)
}
```

**4.3 Task: Android TV HTTP/2 Failure**

1. Force HTTP/1.1 for all TV module OkHttpClient instances
2. Verify with Mi Box 4 test device or emulator (API 28)
3. Test: Login → Browse → Play all use HTTP/1.1

```kotlin
// In TV module OkHttpClient builder
val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .protocols(listOf(Protocol.HTTP_1_1))  // RULE-TV-001
    .build()
```

**4.4 Task: TV Focus Navigation**

1. Audit every screen in TV module for focus handling
2. Ensure all clickable elements have `android:focusable="true"`
3. Verify D-pad navigation order with `nextFocusUp/Down/Left/Right`
4. Test: Navigate entire app with D-pad only, no touch

**Verification for Phase 4:**
```bash
# All critical bugs have regression tests
cd catalog-api && go test ./services/video -run TestVideoPlayer_SubtitleTypeConsistency -count=1
cd catalog-api && go test ./auth -run TestAuth_RateLimiting -count=1

# TV tests on emulator
cd catalogizer-androidtv && ./gradlew connectedCheck

# Security audit passes
gosec ./...  # No critical or high findings
```

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Video player subtitle type mismatch fixed + regression test
- [ ] Rate limiting bypass closed + comprehensive tests
- [ ] TV HTTP/2 forced to HTTP/1.1
- [ ] TV focus navigation works on emulator with D-pad only
- [ ] All fixes verified on real devices (Article VIII)

    Select(ctx context.Context, candidates []LLMModel, phase QAPhase) (LLMModel, error)
    Rank(ctx context.Context, candidates []LLMModel, phase QAPhase) ([]RankedLLM, error)
}
```

**Verification steps:**

### PHASE 6: Backend Integration Hardening (catalog-api)
**Duration: 10 days | Owner: Backend Lead + AI Agent**

**Goal:** Every endpoint in `catalog-api` works correctly with real dependencies, handles all error cases, and performs within budget.

**Entry Criteria:** Phase 4 complete (critical bugs fixed).

**5.1 Task: Endpoint-by-Endpoint Audit**

For EVERY endpoint in `catalog-api`:

1. **Happy path test** — Expected input → Expected output
2. **Error path test** — Invalid input → Proper error (not 500)
3. **Auth test** — No token → 401, Invalid token → 403
4. **Rate limit test** — Excessive requests → 429
5. **Database error test** — DB down → Graceful degradation
6. **Large payload test** — Max file size, max directory listing

**5.2 Task: Protocol Integration Matrix**

Test every CRUD operation across all protocols:

| Operation | Local | SMB | FTP | NFS | WebDAV |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| Scan directory | Test | Test | Test | Test | Test |
| Read file | Test | Test | Test | Test | Test |
| Write file | Test | Test | Test | Test | Test |
| Delete file | Test | Test | Test | Test | Test |
| Rename file | Test | Test | Test | Test | Test |
| Large file (>1GB) | Test | Test | Test | Test | Test |
| Unicode filename | Test | Test | Test | Test | Test |
