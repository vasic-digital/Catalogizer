**Objective:** Zero unfinished, undocumented, broken, or disabled items across all 7 components + infrastructure

---

## PART 1: COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT — CURRENT STATE

### 1.1 Overall Health Summary

| Component | Build | Tests | Coverage | Status |
|-----------|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| catalog-api (Go) | PASS | 42 packages pass | 30.7% avg | Production |
| catalog-web (React) | PASS | 1,623 tests pass | ~45% | Production |
| catalog-web E2E | PASS | 314 tests (25 specs) | N/A | Production |
| catalogizer-desktop | PASS | 15 test files | ~36% | Production |
| installer-wizard | PASS | 178 tests | ~42% | Production |
| catalogizer-android | PASS | 45 test files | ~78% | Production |
| catalogizer-androidtv | PASS | 27 test files | ~80% | Production |
| catalogizer-api-client | PASS | 7 test files | ~37% | Production |
| WebSocket-Client-TS | PASS | 4 test files | ~18% | Production |
| UI-Components-React | PASS | 11 test files | ~26% | Production |

### 1.2 Test Results (Verified 2026-03-04)

**Go Backend:** All 42 packages pass (5 [no test files] packages: `cmd/boot`, `internal/cache`, `internal/eventbus`, `internal/media`, `tests/testutils`)

**Known Test Skips (by design):**
- Filesystem integration tests (FTP, NFS, WebDAV, SMB) — require live protocol servers
- NFS tests — require root privileges for kernel module
- Protocol rename tests — FTP/NFS/WebDAV client implementations pending
- Automation/stress tests — skipped in `-short` mode
- User flow tests — skip when no auth token available

### 1.3 Coverage Gaps (Go Backend — Packages Below 50%)

| Package | Current | Target | Gap |
|---------|---------|--------|-----|
| `challenges` | 4.2% | 60% | +55.8% |
| `smb` | 16.7% | 60% | +43.3% |
| `services` | 24.6% | 60% | +35.4% |
| `filesystem` | 29.4% | 60% | +30.6% |
| `handlers` | 30.4% | 60% | +29.6% |
| `internal/services` | 30.3% | 60% | +29.7% |
| `internal/handlers` | 31.0% | 60% | +29.0% |
| `internal/media/realtime` | 31.0% | 60% | +29.0% |
| `database` | 40.4% | 60% | +19.6% |
| `internal/media/analyzer` | 40.7% | 60% | +19.3% |
| `repository` | 48.6% | 60% | +11.4% |

### 1.4 Packages With No Test Files

| Package | Type | Action Required |
|---------|------|----------------|
| `cmd/boot` | Entry point | Add boot sequence tests |
| `internal/cache` | Caching | Add cache operation tests |
| `internal/eventbus` | Event system | Add event pub/sub tests |
| `internal/media` | Media namespace | Add package-level tests |
| `tests/testutils` | Test helpers | No tests needed (helper package) |

### 1.5 Dead Code / Unconnected Features

#### 14 Unwired Go Submodules
These submodules exist at the project root with full code, tests, and docs but are NOT imported by catalog-api via `replace` directives. The CLAUDE.md and Decoupling Plan confirm this is by design — they were extracted for reusability but catalog-api uses its own internal implementations:

| Submodule | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Database/ | Unwired | catalog-api uses own `database/` package |
| Discovery/ | Unwired | catalog-api uses own `internal/services/` |
| Media/ | Unwired | catalog-api uses own `internal/media/` |
| Middleware/ | Unwired | catalog-api uses own `middleware/` |
| Observability/ | Unwired | catalog-api uses own `internal/metrics/` |
| RateLimiter/ | Unwired | catalog-api uses own `middleware/` |
| Security/ | Unwired | catalog-api uses own `internal/auth/` |
| Storage/ | Unwired | catalog-api uses own `internal/services/` |
| Streaming/ | Unwired | catalog-api uses own `internal/services/` |
| Watcher/ | Unwired | catalog-api uses own `internal/media/realtime/` |
| Auth-Context-React/ | Linked | Used by catalog-web via `file:../` |
| Media-Browser-React/ | Linked | Used by catalog-web via `file:../` |
| Media-Player-React/ | Linked | Used by catalog-web via `file:../` |
| Collection-Manager-React/ | Linked | Used by catalog-web via `file:../` |
| Dashboard-Analytics-React/ | Linked | Used by catalog-web via `file:../` |
| Media-Types-TS/ | Linked | Used by catalog-web via `file:../` |
| Catalogizer-API-Client-TS/ | Linked | Used by catalog-web via `file:../` |

**Verdict:** The 10 unwired Go submodules are intentionally standalone libraries. They are not dead code — they are available for future consumers. No action required beyond ensuring they build and pass their own tests.

#### Protocol Client Implementations Pending
From `tests/integration/protocol_rename_tests.go`:
- FTP rename detection: `t.Skip("FTP client implementation pending")`
- NFS rename detection: `t.Skip("NFS client implementation pending")`
- WebDAV rename detection: `t.Skip("WebDAV client implementation pending")`

These represent incomplete protocol-specific rename tracking features.

#### console.error Statements (Frontend)
37 `console.error()` calls in production frontend code. These are legitimate error logging in catch blocks but should be replaced with a structured logging service for production.

### 1.6 Known Issues from Final Report (2026-02-23)

1. **SMB test timing**: Minor non-deterministic goroutine cleanup timing under race detector — no actual race, passes on retry
2. **NFS test container**: Requires root for `modprobe nfs` — NFS integration tests skipped without root

### 1.7 Security Scanning Status

| Tool | Last Run | Status | Issues |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| govulncheck | 2026-02-23 | PASS | 0 vulnerabilities |
| npm audit | 2026-02-23 | PASS | 0 critical/production |

#### 8.2 Security Scan Rerun
```bash
cd catalog-api && govulncheck ./...
cd catalog-web && npm audit --production
./scripts/snyk-scan.sh

## PART 4: SUMMARY

### Work Items by Phase

| Phase | Items | Sessions | Priority |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| Phase 0: Security Scanning | 6 scan types, analyze, fix | 1 | CRITICAL |
| Phase 1: Go Test Coverage | 8 sub-tasks, ~150 test functions | 3-4 | HIGH |
| Phase 2: Frontend Test Coverage | 5 sub-tasks, ~80 test functions | 2-3 | HIGH |
| Phase 3: Advanced Test Types | 6 sub-tasks (fuzz, contract, chaos) | 2-3 | MEDIUM |
| Phase 4: Challenge Expansion | 15 new challenges | 1-2 | MEDIUM |
| Phase 5: Safety Hardening | 5 sub-tasks (leaks, deadlocks, races) | 2 | HIGH |
| Phase 6: Monitoring & Optimization | 4 sub-tasks | 1-2 | MEDIUM |
| Phase 7: Documentation | 6 sub-tasks, 8+ new files | 2-3 | MEDIUM |
| Phase 8: Final Verification | 6 verification steps | 1 | CRITICAL |
| **TOTAL** | **49 sub-tasks** | **15-21 sessions** | |

### Constraints (from CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md)

- **Resources:** Max 30-40% host resources. `GOMAXPROCS=3`, `-p 2 -parallel 2` for Go tests.
- **Containers:** Podman only, `--network host`, fully qualified image names, max 4 CPUs / 8 GB RAM.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions PERMANENTLY DISABLED. All CI/CD runs locally.
- **Protocol:** HTTP/3 (QUIC) + Brotli mandatory. Fallback: HTTP/2 + gzip.
- **Database:** Write via dialect abstraction only. Use `database.WrapDB()` for test DBs.
- **Challenges:** Sequential only, never parallel. RunAll is blocking.
- **Security:** No root/sudo. No interactive prompts.
- **Git:** Push to all 6 remotes after committing: `GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -o BatchMode=yes" git push origin main`
- **Zero-warning policy:** No console warnings, no failed network requests, no deprecation warnings.

### Success Criteria

1. **Zero broken components** — all 7 components build and all tests pass
2. **60%+ Go backend coverage** — up from 30.7%
3. **Zero security vulnerabilities** — govulncheck, npm audit, Snyk, SonarQube all clean
4. **Zero race conditions** — `-race` flag passes on full suite
5. **Zero memory leaks** — verified via leak detector tests
6. **224+ challenges passing** — 209 existing + 15 new
7. **Complete documentation** — 8 video course modules, updated website, all guides current
8. **Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK** — already verified clean (0 found in production code)
9. **All test types represented** — unit, integration, E2E, stress, fuzz, contract, performance, chaos
10. **Production monitoring ready** — Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, health endpoints
