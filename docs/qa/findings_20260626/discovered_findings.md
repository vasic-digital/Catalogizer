# Discovered Findings — 2026-06-26 (during §11.4.170 work)

**Status:** FINDING-1 **RESOLVED** (both legs fixed + guarded, 2026-06-26) · FINDING-2 **OPEN** (operator-gated upstream renumber). Captured by independent read-only subagents (§11.4.142/.150); FINDING-1 fixed by independent subagents + conductor-reviewed/re-validated (§11.4.142). Evidence is computed contrast ratios + RED→GREEN test runs + commit refs.

## FINDING-1 — Web + desktop carry the SAME sub-AA error-token-as-surface class as the phone (latent) — RESOLVED

**Type:** Bug (accessibility / WCAG). **Severity:** Medium (latent, not yet user-reachable). **Same class as phone fix `d3d00eab`.** **Status:** Fixed (→ both legs), 2026-06-26.

The defect: a dark error color token (`#EF4444`) used as an error **surface/background** paired with a light foreground (`#F8FAFC`) → contrast **3.60:1**, below WCAG AA 4.5:1 for normal text (passes only as large text/UI ≥3:1).

| Client | file:line | Mode | BG | FG | Ratio | AA | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| desktop | `catalogizer-desktop/src/styles/globals.css:76-77` | dark | `--destructive`=#EF4444 | `--destructive-foreground`=#F8FAFC | **3.60:1** | FAIL (normal) | **WIRED** via `tailwind.config.js:41-44` → `bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground` is a live class; one component away from rendering (current consumer `src/pages/LoginPage.tsx:63` is a safe 10% tint). LATENT. |
| desktop | `globals.css:46-47` | light | #DC2626 | #FFFFFF | 4.83:1 | PASS | ok |
| web | `catalog-web/src/index.css:52-53` | dark | #EF4444 | #F8FAFC | **3.60:1** | FAIL | DEFINED but DORMANT — not wired into `tailwind.config.js` (no `destructive` color), consumed nowhere. Real destructive surface = `src/components/ui/Button.tsx:11` `bg-red-600 text-white` = #DC2626/#FFFFFF = 4.83:1 PASS. |

Neither client has a WCAG contrast oracle guarding the destructive pair (desktop `tokens.test.ts` only checks tokens.ts↔tokens.css drift) — the exact gap that let the phone defect ship.

**RESOLUTION (2026-06-26 — §11.4.115 RED→GREEN, §11.4.145 impact-reasoned, §11.4.142 conductor-reviewed + re-validated):**

| Leg | Commit | Fix | Before→After | New regression guard (§11.4.135) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| desktop (WIRED, priority) | `dac3fc6e` | dark `--destructive-foreground` `--cz-neutral-foreground`(#F8FAFC) → `--cz-neutral-background`(#020817); **surface left intact** because `--destructive` is dual-purpose (also `text-destructive` error text on LoginPage near-black bg — §11.4.145 fix-A-creates-B avoided) | **3.59:1 → 5.32:1** | `catalogizer-desktop/src/styles/wcag_contrast.test.ts` (vitest, 5/5; self-validated golden-bad) |
| web (dormant) | `1afec970` | dark `--destructive` #EF4444 → red-700 #B91C1C (token source `tokens.ts` + `index.css` drift-synced) | **3.59:1 → 6.17:1** | `catalog-web/src/styles/__tests__/wcag_contrast.test.ts` (vitest, 3/3; self-validated golden-bad) |

Both guards parse the **actual edited token** out of the CSS and compute the WCAG sRGB-relative-luminance ratio (no hardcoded assertion), each with a §11.4.107(10) self-validation case (golden-bad #EF4444/#F8FAFC computes < 4.5). RED captured on the pre-fix token (3.59:1 FAIL), GREEN after (≥ AA). Light themes unchanged (4.83:1). Conductor independently re-ran both suites (web 3/3, desktop 5/5 PASS) before commit. These two tests are now the standing §11.4.135 regression guards — vitest auto-discovers `*.test.ts`, so they run on every `npm test`.

## FINDING-2 — Upstream constitution `04d71da` has duplicate anchor numbers §11.4.140 and §11.4.141

**Type:** Task (governance integrity). **Severity:** Medium. **Pre-existing upstream debt — NOT introduced by, and correctly NOT touched by, the §11.4.170 commit `fc84675`.**

In `submodules/constitution/Constitution.md` at upstream HEAD `04d71da`:
- `### §11.4.140` appears **twice**: "Universal action-prefix system" (~line 8996, 2026-06-09) AND "Mandatory HelixTranslate canonical translation pipeline" (~line 9821, 2026-06-25, renamed from old §11.4.133 by `04d71da`).
- `### §11.4.141` appears **twice**: "Token-efficiency mandate" (~line 9091, 2026-06-09) AND "Mandatory independent per-language translation review" (~line 9851, 2026-06-25, new in `04d71da`).

The `04d71da` commit ("fix §11.4.140 numbering collision") moved the translation block off the §11.4.133 collision but onto already-occupied 140/141.

**Why not fixed here:** renumbering an anchor changes its identity + every cross-reference + the propagation-gate literal (`CM-COVENANT-114-140/141-PROPAGATION`) across the whole consumer fleet — high-blast-radius, operator-gated (§11.4.101). Also the translation clauses are the upstream author's; renumbering them without coordination risks colliding with their next push.

**Recommended:** operator decides the free numbers for the translation pipeline + translation review clauses (e.g. §11.4.171/§11.4.172), then a dedicated commit renumbers the two blocks + their gate literals + carrier mirrors, with §11.4.157 lockstep (the carriers also lag — `04d71da` added 140/141 to Constitution.md only, not to CLAUDE/AGENTS/QWEN/GEMINI).
