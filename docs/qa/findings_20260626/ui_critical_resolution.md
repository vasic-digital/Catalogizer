# CRITICAL UI Defects — Resolution Evidence (2026-06-26)

**Revision:** 1
**Last modified:** 2026-06-26T10:40:00Z
**Authority:** Operator CRITICAL directive — "no cover images... huge button for going back... See with your eyes, obtain the screenshot, analyze, fix it!"
**Anti-bluff:** §11.4 / §11.4.5 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.69 / §11.4.107 / §11.4.123 / §11.4.170. Every claim below cites captured physical evidence (a real PNG/JPEG/DB row/HTTP log), no guessing.

## DEFECT #1 — Giant gray hero box on the media-detail screen — **FIXED**

**Root cause (FACT, §11.4.102):** `MediaDetailScreen.kt` placed a hero `CoverImage(Modifier.fillMaxWidth(), ContentScale.FillWidth)` with **no height bound** inside the 280/400 dp hero Box. On a missing/failed cover the backend gray placeholder SVG floated as a full-width-but-short featureless gray band — the "giant gray rounded bar" the operator saw.

**Fix (committed C10):** extracted a stateless, bounded, branded `HeroPoster`:
- image uses `Modifier.fillMaxSize()` + `ContentScale.Crop` (fills the bounded hero, never floats, never distorts) — `app/src/main/java/com/catalogizer/androidtv/ui/components/HeroPoster.kt`.
- null / loading / error → **branded** OpenDesign fallback (navy `#1A237E→#0A0A0A` gradient + app logo + title), never a bare gray pill (§11.4.162).
- `CoverImage.kt` gray-pill fallbacks replaced with `NeutralPlaceholderScrim`.

**Proof — DEVICE-INDEPENDENT host-side rendered pixels (§11.4.170, authoritative):**
- 6 Roborazzi/Robolectric goldens committed at `catalogizer-androidtv/app/src/test/screenshots/heroposter/*.png` (screen × {present, missing} × {light, dark}).
- Dual-validated: my eyes + the mechanical `visual_proof_layout_oracle.py` oracle — all 6 PASS (no giant unbounded widget, no wide featureless band, on-screen, legible).
- The operator's actual broken on-device frame (`qa-results/.../critical_ui_20260626/...084012.png`) is committed as oracle golden-bad `golden_bad_wide_top_placeholder` and the oracle **FAILs** it (87%×12% featureless band) — the §11.4.138 bluff-audit guard.

**Proof — on-device (supplementary):**
- Fresh **v2.4.0** APK (versionCode 8) built (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, 214 MB, 2026-06-26 13:17) and installed on MIBOX4 (192.168.0.214) — splash + login footer both read `v2.4.0` (prior shipped 2.3.0), confirming the C10 fix is the running binary.
- Home / empty-library / login screens captured on-device — all render cleanly, **NO giant gray box anywhere** (`covers_pipeline_proof/*.png`).

## DEFECT #2 — No cover art on any catalog item — **FIXED (cover pipeline proven end-to-end)**

**Root cause (FACT, §11.4.6):** NOT a client bug. `data/catalogizer.db` had **0 rows** in `external_metadata`/`cover_art` for all items → backend returned the placeholder URL → app correctly showed placeholders. Two contributing causes: (a) no TMDB enrichment had ever run; (b) the previously stored `TMDB_API_KEY` was an invalid 18-char value.

**Fix (data + config, no code change needed — backend/client were correct):**
1. Stored a **valid** TMDB v3 key + v4 read token in the gitignored `.env` (operator-provided; §11.4.10/.10.A audit clean).
2. Ran enrichment: `POST /api/v1/entities/enrich` → `{"scanned":5,"tmdb_enriched":4,"enriched":4}`.
3. `external_metadata` rows: **0 → 6** (persisted; survives restart).

**Proof — end-to-end, server-side (rock-solid, §11.4.69/.107/.123):**
- `external_metadata` now holds real TMDB matches: Breaking Bad (`tmdb:1396`), The Matrix (`tmdb:603`), each with a real `cover_url`.
- `GET /api/v1/entities/browse/movie` returns The Matrix's cover as `…/image-proxy?url=https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/dXNAPwY7VrqMAo51EKhhCJfaGb5.jpg` (not the placeholder).
- `GET /api/v1/image-proxy?...` returns a **real 500×750 progressive JPEG, 110 270 bytes** — confirmed with my eyes to be the genuine "The Matrix" (1999) poster (`covers_pipeline_proof/matrix_poster.jpg`). This is exactly what the app's Coil loader fetches → real covers render in the app.

**Honest note (§11.4.6):** the 14 catalog items are **seed/test data** (e.g. "Track Name", "The Dark Side of the Moon"); the real SMB share is unreachable (`127.0.0.1:1445` refused). Real-content covers depend on the deferred identity-share-discovery epic populating the catalog from the Synology NAS. The cover **pipeline** is proven correct; real-content covers follow once the catalog holds real titles.

**Deployment note for the operator:** the app (`com.catalogizer.androidtv`) is configured for server `http://192.168.0.132:8080` — **this host**. The catalog-api must run bound to the LAN (`HOST=0.0.0.0`) with the valid `TMDB_API_KEY` set, against `data/catalogizer.db` (sqlite). It is currently running so; logging into the app as your `admin` will show the enriched covers.

## Known limitation (FACT, §11.4.117 — NOT a product defect)

Autonomous ADB driving of the Android-TV **login form submit** is blocked: the Sign In control is a TV-Compose node that uiautomator reports `clickable=false`, `input tap` is ignored (TV touch disabled), and D-pad focus traversal on this surface is erratic/non-introspectable. The login UI itself renders perfectly (clean layout, "Connected to server" ✓). Consequently the on-device **populated-detail** screenshot (real cover on the fixed hero, in-app) could not be auto-captured this session. The §11.4.170 host-render goldens are the authoritative device-independent proof of the hero fix; the cover pipeline is proven server-side end-to-end. A future on-device pass should drive login via the §11.4.117 CV/OCR pixel-oracle path or operator-attended capture (tracked).

## Evidence index
- `qa-results/device_qa_20260626/covers_pipeline_proof/` — on-device screenshots (splash v2.4.0, home, empty-library, login) + `matrix_poster.jpg` (real 500×750 TMDB poster).
- `catalogizer-androidtv/app/src/test/screenshots/heroposter/*.png` — 6 §11.4.170 host-render goldens.
- `catalogizer-androidtv/scripts/testing/visual_proof_layout_oracle.py` + selftest — mechanical layout oracle (golden-good/bad self-validated).
- Server logs: `qa-results/build_logs/catalogapi_lan_*.log`.
