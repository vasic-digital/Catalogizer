# Master Completion Report — 2026-04-11

This document is the single source of truth for the comprehensive completion initiative started on 2026-04-11. It summarizes every phase's deliverables, exit-criteria status, before/after metrics, and links to the evidence.

**Master roadmap**: [`docs/plans/2026-04-11-comprehensive-completion-audit-and-roadmap.md`](../plans/2026-04-11-comprehensive-completion-audit-and-roadmap.md)

**Session range on main**: `9d9a4957..41039a4f` — **18 commits** on the superproject plus full submodule sync (20 fast-forward pushes + 4 merge commits).

---

## Phase 0 — Audit & Baseline ✅

**Deliverable**: [`docs/plans/2026-04-11-comprehensive-completion-audit-and-roadmap.md`](../plans/2026-04-11-comprehensive-completion-audit-and-roadmap.md)

60+ concrete findings across code completeness (CC-*), concurrency safety (CS-*), database dialect (DB-*), documentation (DOC-*), security (SEC-*), performance (PO-*).

---

## Phase 1 — Concurrency Safety & Data-Race Hardening ✅

**Sub-plan**: [`docs/plans/2026-04-11-phase-1-concurrency-hardening.md`](../plans/2026-04-11-phase-1-concurrency-hardening.md)

| Commit | Fix |
|---|---|
| `05b1a732` | `catalog-api/smb/types.go` — `StopCleanup()` now uses `sync.WaitGroup.Wait()`; restart-after-stop rebuilds the channel; separate `lifecycleMu` serializes Start/Stop. 3 new regression tests. |
| `01b129e8` | `catalog-api/middleware/{shutdown,request,advanced_rate_limiter}.go` — new `middleware.StopAll()` registry; `main.go` drains it during shutdown. `AdvancedRateLimiter.Stop()` is `sync.Once`-protected. 6 new tests. |
| `6c365cff` | `catalog-api/services/log_management_service.go` — `streamLogEntries` channel send wrapped in `select` with `<-done` and 5 s timeout. 3 regression tests. |
| `8368292d` | `catalog-api/handlers/media_entity_handler.go` — TMDB enrichment `UPDATE` errors logged instead of discarded. |
| `f4536b1d` | `catalogizer-desktop/src/{components/VLCPlayer,hooks/useVLCPlayer}` — `.catch(() => {})` → `console.warn` with context. |

**Exit criteria**: ✅ `go test -race ./smb/ ./middleware/ ./services/ ./handlers/` all green. New regression tests cover every CS-* finding.

**Triage correction**: CS-05 (websocket connCount), CS-06 (cache wg.Add race), CS-08 (websocket ticker) were false positives — code already correct.

---

## Phase 2 — Stub Implementation Completion ✅

Commit: `e03f2518` — **feat(phase-2)**

- **ReportingService** (`services/reporting_service.go`): `calculateGrowthRate`, `calculatePerformanceMetrics`, `calculateResponseTimes`, `calculateSystemLoad`, `calculateErrorRates`, vulnerability tracking — all read real data via new `internal/metrics/snapshot.go` (Prometheus registry + Go runtime).
- **CacheService.Warmup** (`internal/services/cache_service.go`): pulls top-500 recent hits and re-runs through `Get()` to warm the DB buffer pool.
- **PlaybackPositionService.SyncAcrossDevices** (`internal/services/playback_position_service.go`): initial implementation tried to collapse duplicates; corrected in Phase 4 after realizing the schema's `UNIQUE(user_id, media_item_id)` constraint makes sync implicit.
- **MediaRecognitionService** (`internal/services/media_recognition_service.go`): `searchLocalCoverArt` scans real directories for cover/poster/folder artwork; 4 API methods return typed `ErrMetadataProviderNotConfigured`.
- **SMBService.Connect** (`internal/services/smb.go`): real SMB handshake with bounded 5 s dial timeout via new `smbDialTimeout` constant.
- **Challenge stubs**: `ch044_websocket_latency` and `ch081_088` replaced "passes as stub" with honest `StatusSkipped`.

**Performance win**: SMB test suite runtime **268 s → 10 s** thanks to bounded dial timeout.

---

## Phase 3 — Database Dialect Parity ✅

Commit: `f5b5cc95` — **feat(phase-3)**

- New `.sqlite.up.sql` reference files for migrations 000002, 000003, 014, 015.
- New `database/migrations_parity_test.go::TestRunMigrationsSQLite` — runs the full migration chain on a fresh SQLite DB, asserts ≥14 rows in `migrations` afterward.

**Exit criteria**: ✅ Parity test green at boot. Any missing dispatch function would fail immediately.

---

## Phase 4 — Test Coverage Maximization ✅

Commits: `ad0b0a40`, `7b4c491d`

| Area | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `internal/metrics` line coverage | 47.4% | **90.7%** |
| `catalog-api/smb` line coverage | 47.7% | 50.2% |
| New tests | — | 7 metrics snapshot + 3 smb validation + 4 SyncAcrossDevices |

**Hidden bug found via test**: `pkg/httpclient.LoginWithRetry` burned 155 s of exponential backoff on 401. Added typed `AuthError` + `errors.As` short-circuit. Test `TestAssetServingChallenge_Execute_LoginFails` runtime dropped from **135 s → 0.01 s**.

**Phase 2 correction**: `SyncAcrossDevices` collapse implementation was wrong — schema constraint makes it impossible. Reverted to validation-only honest implementation.

---

## Phase 5 — Stress, Soak & Integration Test Suite ✅

Commit: `78366168` — **feat(phase-5)**

- `tests/k6/breakpoint_test.js` — `ramping-arrival-rate` executor, abort-on-fail thresholds at p95 > 1500 ms or error rate > 10%.
- `tests/k6/endurance_test.js` — 4-hour constant 25 VUs with hourly stability thresholds.
- `tests/k6/concurrent_writers_test.js` — 15 writers + 35 readers contending on shared playback-position rows.
- `scripts/run-race-detector.sh` — walks catalog-api + 23 Go submodules, runs `GOMAXPROCS=3 go test -race` with summary + non-zero exit.

**Found by the new runner**: 6 data races in `responsiveness_test.go` on `successCount`/`errorCount` `int64` counters. Migrated to `atomic.Int64`, all green.

---

## Phase 6 — Performance Monitoring & Dashboards ✅

Commit: `9cd51bb6` — **feat(phase-6)**

- Removed `profiles: [monitoring]` from `deployment/docker-compose.yml` Prometheus and Grafana services — now started by default with explicit resource caps (0.5 CPU / 512 MB each).
- Grafana `GRAFANA_PORT` default shifted from 3000 → 3001 to avoid colliding with catalog-web.
- New `monitoring/grafana/dashboards/catalogizer-runtime.json` — 8 panels covering HTTP latency p50/p95/p99, error rate by status class, in-flight connections, WebSocket connections, Go goroutines, memory (alloc/heap/sys), DB query duration p95, SMB source health.

**Closes the loop**: Phase 2's ReportingService reads from `internal/metrics/snapshot.go`; Grafana shows the same metrics to the operator.

---

## Phase 7 — Security Scanning ✅

Commit: `0119c272` — **feat(phase-7)**

- `scripts/security-scan-all.sh` — rootless orchestrator running govulncheck, npm audit, Semgrep (Compose profile), SonarQube, Snyk in sequence.
- Per-scanner modes (`--govulncheck-only`, `--snyk-only`, etc.).
- Aggregates to `docs/reports/security/<date>/CONSOLIDATED.md`.
- Skips gracefully when tokens (`SNYK_TOKEN`, `SONAR_TOKEN`) are absent.
- Baseline run: `docs/reports/security/20260411-153546/govulncheck.txt` — catalog-api clean.

SonarQube and Snyk were already wired in `docker-compose.security.yml`; what was missing was the unified entry point.

---

## Phase 8 — Documentation Sync & Extension ✅

Commits: `56bd65da`, `2bdb7e84`

- `catalog-api/AGENTS.md` — new 320-line multi-agent coordination guide (DOC-01).
- `Database/ARCHITECTURE.md` + `pkg/database/database_edge_test.go` + `pkg/dialect/dialect_edge_test.go` — absorbed from gitlab divergent branch (DOC-02).
- Version bumps across `docs/guides/USER_MANUAL.md`, `docs/guides/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md`, `docs/deployment/KUBERNETES_DEPLOYMENT.md` (DOC-03..05).
- `docs/diagrams/sources/` — 6 canonical Mermaid sources + README with rendering instructions:
  - `architecture.mmd` — C4 container view
  - `media-aggregation.mmd` — post-scan entity pipeline
  - `auth-flow.mmd` — JWT sequence
  - `helixqa-pipeline.mmd` — autonomous QA flow
  - `database-dialect-rewriting.mmd` — wrapper rewrite pipeline
  - `tv-channels-flow.mmd` — Android TV home-screen channels (DOC-12)

---

## Phase 9 — Video Course Extension ✅

Commit: `ec49fe0c` — **docs(phase-9)**

Six new module scripts (31–36):
- **Module 31** — Database Dialect Rewriting & Migration Parity
- **Module 32** — Concurrency Hardening: From Race to Atomic
- **Module 33** — Stress, Soak & Spike Testing with k6
- **Module 34** — Wiring SonarQube + Snyk via Compose
- **Module 35** — Lazy Loading & Semaphore Patterns
- **Module 36** — Universal Test Infrastructure with HelixQA

Course outline bumped: 30 → **36 modules**, 16-18 hours → 18-20 hours.

---

## Phase 10 — Website Refresh ✅

Commit: `41039a4f` — **docs(phase-10)**

- `Website/features.md` — new "What's New in v2.3" section covering all phase 1–9 deliverables.
- `Website/course.md` — v2.2.0 → v2.3.0, 17 → 36 modules.
- `Website/changelog.md` — (already updated in Phase 8 batch `56bd65da`).
- `Website/.vitepress/config.ts` — removed 3 known-dead sidebar links to `/docs/developer-guide/*`.

---

## Phase 11 — HelixQA Full Validation Campaign ⏸

**Deferred** — requires live device sessions, llama.cpp RPC workers, and multi-hour wall-clock time that doesn't fit a single planning session. The pre-requisites are all in place (HelixQA submodule updated to v2.3.0 ATMOSphere bank, catalog-api Go race-clean, test banks JSON-ready).

**To execute**: `./scripts/helixqa-orchestrator.sh` on a workstation with `.devconnect` populated.

---

## Phase 12 — Final Verification ✅

### Go catalog-api

```
go build ./...                     # clean
go vet ./...                       # clean
go test -race ./smb/ ./middleware/ ./services/ ./internal/services/ \
                ./internal/metrics/ ./handlers/ ./database/ \
                ./challenges/ ./tests/stress/ -p 2 -parallel 2 -count=1
```

| Package | Result |
|---|---|
| `catalogizer/smb` | ok  6.323s |
| `catalogizer/middleware` | ok  8.583s |
| `catalogizer/services` | ok  58.039s |
| `catalogizer/internal/services` | ok  14.921s |
| `catalogizer/internal/metrics` | ok  1.347s |
| `catalogizer/handlers` | ok  15.439s |
| `catalogizer/database` | ok  1.541s |
| `catalogizer/challenges` | ok  87.445s |
| `catalogizer/tests/stress` | ok  44.463s |

All 9 affected packages green under `-race`.

### Submodule sync

| Submodule | Action |
|---|---|
| 20 submodules | Fast-forward push of `MANDATORY: Add ZERO UNFINISHED WORK POLICY` commit to origin |
| `Auth` | Merged gitlab `golang-jwt/jwt/v5 v5.2.1 → v5.2.2` security patch |
| `Database` | Merged gitlab `ARCHITECTURE.md` + 2 edge-test files (540 lines absorbed) |
| `Lazy` | Resolved duplicate-content merge (AGENTS.md policy preserved) |
| `HelixQA` | Absorbed ATMOSphere test bank (235 lines) + conflict resolution in `screen_states.go` / `tvkeyboard.go` |

All 6 root-repo remotes synced at `41039a4f`.

### Known pre-existing issues (not introduced or fixed in this session)

1. **HelixQA Phase 3 OCR/LLM integration**: `pkg/vision/detection` and `pkg/vision/text` import a non-existent `github.com/catalogizer/HelixQA/pkg/vision/core` namespace + missing `gocv.io/x/gocv` + `github.com/otiai10/gosseract/v2` dependencies. Pre-dates this session; documented but not fixed.
2. **Auth stress test flakiness**: `TestStress_ConcurrentJWTRefresh` asserts refreshed tokens are unique, but JWT refresh is deterministic within a second (same `iat`/`exp`). The test is inherently flaky by design.
3. **LLMProvider gemini_cli_stub / junie_cli_stub**: Intentional fallback stubs when the CLI module is unavailable. Kept but documented as intentional.

## What remains (not deferred, not started)

1. **Phase 4 test coverage** — push every package to ≥95% line coverage. Current catalog-api snapshot:
   - `catalogizer/handlers` 45.1%
   - `catalogizer/database` 54.3%
   - `catalogizer/internal/services` 68.0%
   - `catalogizer/internal/handlers` 68.1%
   Most everything else is ≥80%. Achieving 95% per package needs dedicated per-file test-writing sessions.

2. **Phase 6 lazy/semaphore audit** — `scripts/audit-lazy-init.sh` + `scripts/audit-semaphores.sh` not written; the master roadmap lists them but they were not a blocker for Prometheus/Grafana enablement.

3. **Phase 7 SonarQube scan execution** — `security-scan-all.sh --sonarqube-only` requires an actual running SonarQube container + a `SONAR_TOKEN` — not wired into CI as a gate in this session.

4. **Phase 11 HelixQA validation run** — needs `.devconnect` populated with reachable Android TV devices + distributed vision provider running.

5. **Version bump to v2.4.0** — current work is v2.3.0. The master roadmap calls for v2.4.0 after Phase 12 — deferred until Phases 4/6/11 are genuinely complete.
