## Module 1 Exercises: Introduction and Installation

### Exercise 1.1: Install Catalogizer Locally

**Objective**: Set up a complete Catalogizer development environment and verify all services start correctly.

**Prerequisites**: Git, Go 1.24+, Node.js 18+, a terminal

**Steps**:

1. Clone the repository and initialize submodules:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url> Catalogizer
   cd Catalogizer
   git submodule init && git submodule update --recursive
   ```

2. Set up the backend. Navigate to the catalog-api directory and create a `.env` file:

   ```bash
   cd catalog-api
   cat > .env << 'EOF'
   PORT=8080
   GIN_MODE=debug
   DB_TYPE=sqlite
   JWT_SECRET=exercise-dev-secret-key
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
   EOF
   ```

3. Install Go dependencies and start the backend:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   go run main.go
   ```

4. Open a second terminal. Set up and start the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd catalog-web
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. Verify the login page loads.

6. Log in with the default admin credentials (admin / admin123).

**Expected Result**:

- The backend starts and writes a `.service-port` file in `catalog-api/`
- The frontend starts on port 3000 and successfully proxies API requests to the backend
- The browser shows the Catalogizer dashboard after login
- No errors appear in either terminal

**Bonus Challenge**: Check the SQLite database file (`catalogizer.db`) was created in the `catalog-api` directory. Use `sqlite3 catalogizer.db ".tables"` to list all tables and confirm the schema was initialized.

---

### Exercise 1.2: Container-Based Installation

**Objective**: Deploy Catalogizer using Podman Compose and verify all container services are healthy.

**Prerequisites**: Podman 4.0+ and podman-compose installed

**Steps**:

1. From the project root, start the development environment:

   ```bash
   podman-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

2. Verify all containers are running:

   ```bash
   podman ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"
   ```

3. Check container health:

   ```bash
   podman stats --no-stream
   ```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser and verify the application loads.

5. Stop the environment:

   ```bash
   podman-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
   ```

**Expected Result**:

- All containers start without errors
- `podman ps` shows healthy status for all services
- Resource usage stays within configured limits (max 4 CPUs, 8 GB RAM total)
- The web interface loads and connects to the backend

**Bonus Challenge**: Validate the production compose file without starting it: `podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml config --quiet`. Fix any validation errors you find.

## Module 2 Exercises: Getting Started with Media Management

### Exercise 2.1: Connect a Storage Source

**Objective**: Add a local filesystem storage root and trigger a scan of media files.

**Prerequisites**: Module 1 completed, Catalogizer running, a directory containing at least 10 media files (videos, music, images)

**Steps**:

1. Log in to Catalogizer at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. Navigate to the storage configuration page.

3. Add a new storage root:
   - Protocol: Local Filesystem
   - Path: Enter the absolute path to your media directory (e.g., `/home/user/Media`)
   - Name: Give it a descriptive label (e.g., "Local Media")

4. Save the storage root configuration.

5. Trigger a scan of the newly added storage root.

6. Monitor the scan progress. Observe the real-time updates as files are discovered and categorized.

7. Verify the scan results by checking the dashboard for updated media counts.

**Expected Result**:

- The storage root appears in the storage configuration list
- Scanning begins and progress is reported in real time
- The dashboard shows updated counts for total media items
- Scanned files appear in the media browser with detected types (movie, music, etc.)

**Bonus Challenge**: Use the API directly to add a storage root. Send a POST request to `/api/v1/storage-roots` with JSON body containing the path and protocol. Compare the API response with what you see in the web interface.

---

### Exercise 2.2: Browse and Search Media

**Objective**: Navigate the media browser, apply filters, and use the search functionality to find specific content.

**Prerequisites**: Exercise 2.1 completed, media has been scanned

**Steps**:

1. Open the Media Browser from the main navigation.

2. Switch between Grid view and List view. Note the differences in information density.

3. Apply a type filter to show only video files. Then clear it and filter for audio files.

4. Sort the results by file size (largest first), then by date (newest first).

5. Click on any media item to open the detail modal. Review the detected metadata: file type, size, resolution (for video), codec information, and any external metadata from providers.

6. Navigate to the Search page. Enter a search query for a known media title in your collection.

7. Use the advanced search filters:
   - Filter by media type (e.g., movies only)
   - Filter by file size range
   - Combine multiple filters

8. Review the search results and verify they match your query.

**Expected Result**:

- Grid and List views both render correctly with proper media information
- Type filters correctly narrow the displayed results
- Sort ordering changes the display order as expected
- Media detail modal shows file metadata and any enriched external data
- Search returns relevant results matching the query
- Advanced filters narrow results appropriately

**Bonus Challenge**: Open the browser developer tools (F12) and watch the Network tab while performing searches. Identify the API endpoints being called (`/api/v1/media/search`), the query parameters, and the response structure.

2. Navigate to the Admin Panel.

3. Create two new user accounts:
   - User 1: username "viewer", role "viewer" (read-only access)
   - User 2: username "editor", role "editor" (can create collections and manage favorites)

4. Log out and log in as the "viewer" user. Verify:
   - Can browse media and search
   - Cannot create collections or modify settings

5. Log out and log in as the "editor" user. Verify:
   - Can browse media, search, create collections, and add favorites
   - Cannot access the Admin Panel

6. Log back in as admin. Run the security scanning tools:

   ```bash
   cd catalog-api
   # Run Go vulnerability check
   govulncheck ./...

   cd ../catalog-web
   # Run npm audit
   npm audit --production
   ```

7. Review the scan results and note any findings.

**Expected Result**:

- Both user accounts are created successfully

### Exercise 5.2: Set Up Monitoring

**Objective**: Configure Prometheus metrics collection and verify the metrics endpoint.

**Prerequisites**: Exercise 5.1 completed, Catalogizer running

**Steps**:

1. Verify the metrics endpoint is exposed by the backend:

   ```bash
   curl -s http://localhost:8080/metrics | head -20
   ```

2. Examine the available metrics. Look for:
   - HTTP request duration metrics
   - Request count metrics
   - Go runtime metrics (goroutines, memory)

3. Review the Prometheus configuration:

   ```bash
   cat monitoring/prometheus.yml
   ```

4. If Podman is available, start the monitoring stack:

   ```bash
   podman run -d --name prometheus \
     --network host \
     -v $(pwd)/monitoring/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml:ro \
     --cpus=1 --memory=2g \
     docker.io/prom/prometheus:latest
   ```

5. Access Prometheus at `http://localhost:9090` and run a query:
   - Query: `up` (shows which targets are being scraped)
   - Query: `go_goroutines` (shows active goroutines in the API)

6. Stop the monitoring container:

   ```bash
   podman stop prometheus && podman rm prometheus
   ```

**Expected Result**:

- The `/metrics` endpoint returns Prometheus-format metrics
- Metrics include HTTP request data, Go runtime stats, and custom application metrics
- Prometheus successfully scrapes the Catalogizer backend
- Queries return valid data in the Prometheus UI

**Bonus Challenge**: Create a simple Grafana dashboard. Run Grafana in a container, connect it to your Prometheus instance, and create a panel showing HTTP request rate over time.

### Exercise 6.2: Add a New API Endpoint

**Objective**: Create a new REST API endpoint following the Handler-Service-Repository pattern used throughout the codebase.

**Prerequisites**: Exercise 6.1 completed, familiarity with Go

**Steps**:

1. Study the existing pattern. Open and read these files:

   ```bash
   # Handler example
   cat catalog-api/handlers/media_entity_handler.go | head -50

   # Service example
   cat catalog-api/services/auth_service.go | head -50

   # Route registration
   cat catalog-api/main.go | grep -A 5 "api/v1"
   ```

2. Create a new handler file `catalog-api/handlers/health_check_handler.go`:

   ```go
   package handlers

   import (
       "net/http"
       "runtime"
       "time"

       "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
   )

   type HealthCheckHandler struct {
       startTime time.Time
   }

   func NewHealthCheckHandler() *HealthCheckHandler {
       return &HealthCheckHandler{
           startTime: time.Now(),
       }
   }

   func (h *HealthCheckHandler) DetailedHealth(c *gin.Context) {
       var memStats runtime.MemStats
       runtime.ReadMemStats(&memStats)

       c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{
           "status":      "healthy",
           "uptime":      time.Since(h.startTime).String(),
           "goroutines":  runtime.NumGoroutine(),
           "memory_mb":   memStats.Alloc / 1024 / 1024,
           "go_version":  runtime.Version(),
           "num_cpu":     runtime.NumCPU(),
       })
   }
   ```

3. Register the route in `main.go` under the `/api/v1` group (study where existing routes are registered and add yours nearby).

4. Write a test file `catalog-api/handlers/health_check_handler_test.go`:

   ```go
   package handlers

   import (
       "encoding/json"
       "net/http"
       "net/http/httptest"
       "testing"

       "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
   )

   func TestDetailedHealth(t *testing.T) {
       gin.SetMode(gin.TestMode)
       handler := NewHealthCheckHandler()

       router := gin.New()
       router.GET("/api/v1/health/detailed", handler.DetailedHealth)

       req := httptest.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, "/api/v1/health/detailed", nil)
       w := httptest.NewRecorder()
       router.ServeHTTP(w, req)

       if w.Code != http.StatusOK {
           t.Errorf("expected status 200, got %d", w.Code)
       }

       var response map[string]interface{}
       if err := json.Unmarshal(w.Body.Bytes(), &response); err != nil {
           t.Fatalf("failed to unmarshal response: %v", err)
       }

       if response["status"] != "healthy" {
           t.Errorf("expected status 'healthy', got '%v'", response["status"])
       }

       if _, ok := response["uptime"]; !ok {
           t.Error("expected 'uptime' field in response")
       }

       if _, ok := response["goroutines"]; !ok {
           t.Error("expected 'goroutines' field in response")
       }
   }
   ```

5. Run your test:

   ```bash
   cd catalog-api
   go test -v -run TestDetailedHealth ./handlers/
   ```

6. Start the server and test the endpoint manually:

   ```bash
   curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health/detailed | python3 -m json.tool
   ```

**Expected Result**:

- The handler compiles without errors
- The test passes with `ok` status
- The endpoint returns a JSON response with status, uptime, goroutines, memory, Go version, and CPU count:

  ```json
  {
      "status": "healthy",
      "uptime": "2m30.123456s",
      "goroutines": 12,
      "memory_mb": 15,
      "go_version": "go1.24",
      "num_cpu": 8
  }
  ```

**Bonus Challenge**: Extend the health check handler to include database connectivity status. Add a method that pings the database and reports whether it is reachable. Write a test for the new method using the test helper's `database.WrapDB()` for an in-memory SQLite database.

---

### Exercise 6.3: Run the Complete Test Suite

**Objective**: Execute the full test suite across all components and verify the zero-error policy.

**Prerequisites**: Exercise 6.1 completed

## Capstone Project

### Project: Build a Custom Media Dashboard

**Objective**: Demonstrate mastery of Catalogizer by building a custom integration that combines backend API knowledge, frontend development, and system administration.

**Prerequisites**: All 6 core module exercises completed

**Requirements**:

1. **Backend**: Create at least one new API endpoint that provides aggregated data not available from existing endpoints (e.g., media statistics by decade, storage protocol usage breakdown, most-accessed media items).

2. **Frontend**: Build a custom dashboard page that consumes your new API endpoint and displays the data using charts or tables. Use React Query for data fetching and Tailwind CSS for styling.

3. **Testing**: Write unit tests for your new backend handler and service. Write a frontend test for your dashboard component. All tests must pass.

4. **Administration**: Document the deployment steps for your feature, including any new environment variables, database migrations, or configuration changes required.

**Deliverables**:

- New Go handler, service, and test files in `catalog-api/`
- New React page component and test in `catalog-web/`
- A brief writeup (1 page) describing your feature, its architecture, and how to deploy it

**Evaluation Criteria**:

- Code follows existing project conventions (constructor injection, table-driven tests, PascalCase components)
- All tests pass
- The feature works end-to-end: backend serves data, frontend displays it
- No console errors, no failed network requests (zero warning/zero error policy)
