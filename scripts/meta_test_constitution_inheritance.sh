# meta_test_constitution_inheritance.sh — paired §1.1 meta-test for the
#   constitution-inheritance gate
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   Prove that scripts/verify_constitution_inheritance.sh is NOT a bluff gate,
#   per Constitution §1.1 (false-positive immunity is an invariant). It does so
#   by invoking the constitution-side helper
#   `submodules/constitution/meta_test_inheritance.sh` with THIS project's gate
#   as the argument. That helper:
#     1. snapshots Constitution.md,
#     2. mutates it (strips the §11.4 anchor line the gate's INV2 asserts),
#     3. runs our gate and asserts the gate now FAILs,
#     4. restores Constitution.md,
#     5. exits 0 only if the gate correctly FAILed on the mutated constitution.
#   A gate that still PASSed on the mutated constitution would be a BLUFF GATE
#   and the helper exits non-zero — which this wrapper propagates.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/meta_test_constitution_inheritance.sh
#     (run from the project root: /Volumes/T7/Projects/catalogizer)
#
# Inputs:
#   - $PROJECT_ROOT (optional) — overrides the auto-resolved project root.
#
# Outputs:
#   - The constitution-side helper's full output (mutation + gate result +
#     META-TEST PASS/FAIL verdict) on stdout/stderr.
#   - Exit status == the helper's exit status (0 = gate has teeth).
#
# Side-effects:
#   - The constitution-side helper temporarily mutates + restores
#     submodules/constitution/Constitution.md (snapshot/restore via a tmp file
#     and an EXIT trap). This wrapper performs NO direct mutation itself.
#
# Dependencies:
#   - bash, the constitution submodule present with meta_test_inheritance.sh,
#     scripts/verify_constitution_inheritance.sh.
#
# Cross-references:
#   - Constitution §1.1 (paired mutation / false-positive immunity).
#   - Constitution §11.4 (anti-bluff covenant).
#   - Constitution §11.4.18 (this in-source doc block).
#   - submodules/constitution/meta_test_inheritance.sh (the helper).
#   - scripts/verify_constitution_inheritance.sh (the gate under test).
