# verify_constitution_inheritance.sh — Constitution-inheritance VERIFICATION GATE
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   Assert that the `submodules/constitution` submodule is really present and
#   genuinely inherited by this project, per Constitution §1.1 (paired-mutation
#   requirement) and §11.4.35 (canonical-root inheritance clarity). This is a
#   hard gate: ANY broken invariant exits non-zero with a directed message so
#   the failure cannot ship green.
#
#   The gate has TEETH: its paired meta-test
#   (scripts/meta_test_constitution_inheritance.sh) drives the constitution-side
#   helper `submodules/constitution/meta_test_inheritance.sh`, which mutates
#   Constitution.md (strips the §11.4 anchor line), runs THIS gate, and asserts
#   it FAILs — proving the gate is not a bluff gate (Constitution §1.1).
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/verify_constitution_inheritance.sh
#     (run from the project root: /Volumes/T7/Projects/catalogizer)
#
# Inputs:
#   - $PROJECT_ROOT (optional) — overrides the auto-resolved project root.
#   - The repository tree (submodules/constitution/** + parent governance docs).
#
# Outputs:
#   - Human-readable PASS/FAIL lines per invariant on stdout/stderr.
#   - Exit 0 ONLY when ALL invariants hold; non-zero (1) on ANY failure.
#
# Side-effects:
#   - NONE. Read-only: it only greps + stats files. It never mutates the tree.
#
# Dependencies:
#   - bash, grep (with -q / -F / -i support — GNU or BSD grep both work).
#
# Cross-references:
#   - Constitution §1.1 (false-positive immunity / paired mutation).
#   - Constitution §11.4 (anti-bluff covenant — END-USER QUALITY GUARANTEE).
#   - Constitution §11.4.18 (this in-source doc block).
#   - Constitution §11.4.35 (canonical-root inheritance clarity).
#   - submodules/constitution/meta_test_inheritance.sh (the paired helper).
#   - scripts/meta_test_constitution_inheritance.sh (the paired meta-test).
#   - tests/test_constitution_inheritance.sh (host-side runner).
